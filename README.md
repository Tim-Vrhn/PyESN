# PyESN
Echo State Network (Reservoir Computing) Coded by pure Python

## Requirements:
Python 3.X,

## Description:
1. This project is written by pure python without Tensorflow, CNTK, Caffe, or other machine learning toolkits, it is a light-weight project you can run it easier.
2. This project is highly modular and structured, that you can extend your own algorithm on it without any obstacles.
3. Download the repository, and run the "main.py" at the top root dir. (It is pretty good if you can give me a star!  ^_^ )
